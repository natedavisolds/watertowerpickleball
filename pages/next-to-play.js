          When courts get crowded, tensions rise. People want to play as much
          as possible but without a system in place, players make up their own
          rules and stake claim to courts that should be public.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one at Water Tower has the right to hold a court exclusively for
          themselves. Instead, we must agree as a Pickleball community to
          share these courts so it is fair for all players. Through
          cooperation, we cultivate a pleasant playing experience for all
          players, raise our reputation with neighbors and other facility
          users, and build a stronger platform to advocate for Pickleball at
          Water Tower.
        </p>

        <h3 id="system">System Objectives</h3>
        <p>Together, we have designed a system that will:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Maximize playtime</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expand the variety of organized formats</strong> (e.g.,
            ladder, round-robin, challenge, leagues, clinics)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Balance opportunities</strong> for similarly skilled
            players to compete with opportunities for differing skilled
            players to meet and connect
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="designated-court-use">Designated Court Use</h2>
        <p>
          There are 6 public courts at Water Tower. They are divided down the
          middle with 3 on the left (north) and three on the right (south).
          Normally, these courts are on a first come, first serve basis until
          filled. However once filled, the <strong>Next to play</strong>{" "}
          system should be activated. If you arrive and want to play but no
          courts are available, try to mix in with a group already playing. If
          there are more than four players waiting for a match or a new group
          arrives to play, the <strong>Next to Play</strong> system should
          begin. The right side (south) as designated for scheduled events
          using <strong>Special Formats</strong>. You will know when a{" "}
          <strong>Special Format</strong> is happening because the gate on the
          southside will be open, the type of format will be written on a
          whiteboard near the entrance, and it will be scheduled with notice
          at{" "}
          <strong>
            <u>watertowerpickleball.com/schedule</u>
          </strong>
          . Otherwise, the southside courts will combine with the northside
          courts in the <strong>Next to Play </strong>format.
        </p>

        <h3 id="next-to-play">Next to Play</h3>
        <p>
          Initiating the <strong>Next to Play</strong> system requires
          everyone on the courts to be notified. Simply walking over to all
          courts and letting the players know that after their current match
          they will need to rotate into the <strong>Next to Play</strong>{" "}
          system. When informed, please comply and rotate according to the{" "}
          <strong>Next to Play</strong> rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no time period specified for the{" "}
          <strong>Next to Play</strong> format. <strong>Next to Play </strong>
          activates on demand whenever there are more players ready to play
          than then there are courts available.
        </p>

        <h4 id="how-system-works">Here’s how the Next to Play system works:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>When no one is waiting, stay and play on your court.</li>
          <li>
            If players have placed their paddles on the{" "}
            <strong>Next to Play</strong> rack, when you finish your game, you
            must exit the courts and place your paddles on the{" "}
            <strong>Next to Play</strong> rack to be in line for an available
            court.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a court is open, the next group should move the next
            marker to the right one group, take their paddles, proceed to the
            court, and start play.
          </li>
          <li>
            A maximum of 1 game to 11 to be played when the{" "}
            <strong>Next to Play</strong> system is activated.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions:</h4>

        <h5 id="not-enough-players">
          What if the court opens up and the next group doesn’t have four
          players?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Everyone waits until the next-in-line group has enough players.
          There is no leapfrogging ahead of players waiting to play. No matter
          how good you are, everyone has an equal right to play. Instead,
          consider splitting your group and joining them so that play
          continues on every court. Otherwise you <strong>MUST</strong> wait
          for more players to come to fill those spaces.
        </p>

        <h5 id="what-if-rematch">What if I want to have a rematch?</h5>
        <p>
          Sometimes it is fun to play with the same group. Maybe you have had
          an exciting match and want to rematch. Or maybe you’ve come to play
          with a specific group of people. You may do so, but first allow
          waiting players a chance to play. Exit the courts and place your
          paddles together in the next group slots. When it’s your turn again,
          then your rematch is on.
        </p>

        <h5 id="what-if-mix-up">What if I don’t want to play with the same players again?</h5>
        <p>
          After playing with the same people a couple of times it is nice to
          mix it up. After completing your match, you can do this by placing
          your paddles in different group slots or holding onto your paddle
          until other players arrive. Each group slot is color coded so you
          know who will be playing together next. As people finish their
          matches they will fill in the gaps and different players will be
          paired together.
        </p>

        <h5 id="what-no-space-on-rack">What happens if there isn’t space on the next-to-play rack?</h5>
        <p>
          Lean your paddle underneath and against the fence. When slots become
          available, those paddles underneath have first dibs on a slot. If
          this continues, then we will need to buy a bigger rack or,
          ultimately, expand the number of available courts.
        </p>

        <h3 id="special-formats">Special Formats</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Next to Play</strong> format will keep the rotation flow
          going so that on any given night walk-up players have the
          opportunity to play.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          However, certain nights will also have available special formats for
          those looking to spice things up or kick it up a notch. The main
          side (left side facing the court from the street, north courts) will
          always use the <strong>Next to Play </strong>format where anyone can
          play, but the right side (south courts) is dedicated for{" "}
          <strong>Special Formats</strong>.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          Some <strong>Special Formats</strong> will require signing up ahead
          of time and have a particular start time. Other formats you can join
          at any time but there might be a skill requirement (example 4.0+) or
          pairing requirement (mixed doubles only). Special formats are run by
          different people from various groups. The event list at{" "}
          <strong>
            <u>watertowerpickleball.com/schedule</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          is the official source for these events. There are many details
          around sharing and permission that need to be worked out and updates
          will come soon. <strong>Special Formats</strong> are estimated to
          begin late Spring/early Summer 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a special format is happening, the gate on the right side of
          the court will be unlocked and open. Those playing in the special
          format should enter and exit from that point while those using the{" "}
          <strong>Next to Play</strong> courts will use the main gate.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to play in a <strong>Special Format</strong>, look at
          the event for how to sign up. There might be special instructions,
          like a skills assessment, group membership, or a donation for
          fundraisers.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a court used by <strong>Special Format</strong> becomes
          available, it immediately returns to the rotation for the{" "}
          <strong>Next to Play</strong> format. Players in the{" "}
          <strong>Special Format </strong>can{" "}
          <i>
            <strong>NOT</strong>
          </i>{" "}
          exclusively use that court when the event is over. They can,
          however, join the rotation on the <strong>Next to Play</strong>{" "}
          system.
        </p>

        <h4 id="typesofspecialformats">
          Types of <strong>Special Formats</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          A <strong>Special Format</strong> may be familiar or brand new to
          players at Water Tower. Below is a list of a few possible{" "}
          <strong>Special Formats</strong> planned for Water Tower, but expect
          organizers to come up with fun and different{" "}
          <strong>Special Formats</strong> throughout the season.
        </p>

        <h5 id="round-robin">Round Robin</h5>
        <p>
          Round Robin tries to have everyone play with everyone else. The
          rotation is set and each round you switch players according to the
          schedule. Players are ranked by wins or points scored, and top
          players advance to a bracket format.{" "}
        </p>

        <h5 id="ladder">Ladder</h5>
        <p>
          Typically, you play with the partner of your choice in this format.
          Random court assignments are drawn to start. Everyone plays one
          game. Winners move up, losers move down. The field eventually
          equalizes. And at the end of the night you find out where you stand.
          This is a great format for those preparing for tournament play.
        </p>

        <h5 id="luck-of-the-draw">Luck of the Draw</h5>
        <p>
          This is a timed mixer event. All games (rounds) last 12 minutes. You
          play with normal scoring rules but once the time is up, you exit and
          record your score differential. Each round you will partner and play
          with different people and tally your score. After a certain number
          of rounds, the players with the highest scores are paired and
          everyone plays a full game to decide the winners.
        </p>

        <h5 id="challenge-court">Challenge Court</h5>
        <p>
          Like Ladder, Challenge court format rewards those that win the game.
          If you win, you play again. If you lose, you go off the courts and
          place your paddles in line to play again. The next players waiting
          step in and begin playing. There is no limit to how many games that
          you can play in a row if you continue to win, but the competition
          will get harder as you tire.
        </p>

        <h5 id="double-elimination">Double Elimination</h5>
        <p>
          You play with the same partner and are typically by skill level. All
          teams are seeded and a bracket is set where the top plays the lowest
          rank. If you lose, you move to the Consolation bracket. If you lose
          a second time, you are eliminated. Play continues until only one
          team is left. They win.
        </p>

        <h5 id="leagues">Leagues</h5>
        <p>
          League play lasts over a series of weeks or months. It can be
          structured in many ways but usually allows a team to play matches
          against everyone else in their division. Games have a set start
          time. Standings are tracked and at the end there is a single
          elimination playoff to determine the league winner.
        </p>

        <h5 id="by-group">Skill, Age, and/or Gender Open Play</h5>
        <p>
          This format uses the same rules as <strong>Next to Play</strong> but
          you must qualify to play. For example, "Women's group" will be for
          women only. Or 3.5 over 60 could be for those at the 3.5 level and
          have an age over 60. These formats will likely be on a rotation
          where the most popular happen more frequently.
        </p>

        <h5 id="reserved-courts">Reserved Courts</h5>
        <p>
          From time to time, the special format will be reserved courts.
          Reserved court allows for a group or individual to exclusively use
          that court. They can stay there all night and play as they wish. The
          Reserved format happens infrequently and will be in conjunction with
          fundraisers benefiting Water Tower Recreation Facility.
